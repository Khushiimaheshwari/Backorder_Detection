# Backorder Prediction Project ðŸšš

This project was completed as a part of **Data Analytics - Virtual Internship** with **iNeuron**. 

## Overview  
Backorders are an inevitable challenge in supply chain management. By anticipating which products are likely to go into backorder, businesses can streamline planning at various levels, reducing unexpected strain on production, logistics, and transportation.  

The goal was to predict backorders in inventory management systems. Backorders, while unavoidable, can create unexpected strain on production, logistics, and transportation. By leveraging historical data from ERP systems, this project aims to construct a predictive model that forecasts backorders, allowing businesses to streamline planning and mitigate disruptions.  

The model classifies products into two categories:  
- **Backorder**: Yes  
- **Backorder**: No

## Features  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web-based user interface built with **Streamlit** for seamless interaction.  
- **Deployment**: Fully deployed and accessible for users to predict backorders.  
- **Machine Learning Workflow**:  
  - **Data Exploration**: Gain insights from the provided dataset.  
  - **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.  
  - **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features to improve model performance.  
  - **Model Building and Testing**: Train and evaluate various ML algorithms to find the best fit.  



## Results  
The system predicts backorder sales for a particular product based on historical data, enabling businesses to:  
- Reduce delays in production and logistics.  
- Optimize inventory management.  
- Enhance overall supply chain efficiency.
